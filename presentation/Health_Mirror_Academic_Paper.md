## III. 方法 (METHODS)

為了提供全面的健康監測功能，Health Mirror系統採用多層人工智能方法，整合了多種先進技術，每種技術在健康檢測和分析中都發揮特定功能。

## III. METHODS

To provide comprehensive health monitoring capabilities, the Health Mirror system adopts a multi-layered AI approach that integrates several advanced technologies, each serving a specific function in health detection and analysis.

### A. YOLO目標檢測引擎 (YOLO Object Detection Engine)

YOLO（You Only Look Once）檢測引擎用於實時識別和分析特定的健康相關特徵。系統採用三個專門的YOLO模型：DarkCircles.pt用於檢測和測量黑眼圈嚴重程度，Lip_types.pt用於分析唇色和狀況，skin.pt用於評估整體皮膚健康。這使得能夠以高準確性和最少處理時間精確定位和分類健康指標。

### A. YOLO Object Detection Engine

YOLO (You Only Look Once) detection engine is utilized to identify and analyze specific health-related features in real-time. The system employs three specialized YOLO models: DarkCircles.pt for detecting and measuring dark circle severity, Lip_types.pt for analyzing lip color and condition, and skin.pt for assessing overall skin health. This enables precise localization and classification of health indicators with high accuracy and minimal processing time.

### B. OpenCV圖像處理管道 (OpenCV Image Processing Pipeline)

OpenCV作為核心圖像處理引擎，處理攝像頭輸入、幀預處理和實時圖像操作。它執行包括降噪、亮度和對比度調整、色彩空間轉換和面部區域提取在內的基本功能。該管道確保為後續AI分析提供最佳圖像質量，同時保持實時性能。

### B. OpenCV Image Processing Pipeline

OpenCV serves as the core image processing engine, handling camera input, frame preprocessing, and real-time image manipulation. It performs essential functions including noise reduction, brightness and contrast adjustment, color space conversion, and facial region extraction. The pipeline ensures optimal image quality for subsequent AI analysis while maintaining real-time performance.

### C. InsightFace識別系統 (InsightFace Recognition System)

通過整合InsightFace技術，Health Mirror能夠準確識別和跟踪多個會話中的個別用戶。系統提取深度面部特徵，執行餘弦相似度計算進行用戶匹配，並維護個性化健康檔案。這使得能夠基於個人健康模式進行長期健康跟踪和個性化建議。

### C. InsightFace Recognition System

By integrating InsightFace technology, Health Mirror can accurately identify and track individual users across multiple sessions. The system extracts deep facial features, performs cosine similarity calculations for user matching, and maintains personalized health profiles. This enables long-term health tracking and personalized recommendations based on individual health patterns.

### D. DeepSORT跟踪算法 (DeepSORT Tracking Algorithm)

DeepSORT算法用於視頻流中的強健目標跟踪和時間一致性。它利用卡爾曼濾波器進行運動預測、匈牙利算法進行最優分配，以及深度特徵提取網絡進行基於外觀的跟踪。這確保了跨幀面部特徵的穩定和準確跟踪，提高了健康測量的可靠性。

### D. DeepSORT Tracking Algorithm

The DeepSORT algorithm is employed for robust object tracking and temporal consistency in video streams. It utilizes Kalman filters for motion prediction, Hungarian algorithm for optimal assignment, and deep feature extraction networks for appearance-based tracking. This ensures stable and accurate tracking of facial features across frames, improving the reliability of health measurements.

### E. Django Web Application Framework

The Django web framework serves as the backbone of the Health Mirror system, providing a robust and scalable platform for web application development. The implementation follows Django's Model-View-Template (MVT) architecture to ensure clean separation of concerns and maintainable code structure.

**Database Management**: Django's Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) system manages user profiles, health detection records, and appointment data through well-defined models. The system utilizes SQLite for development and can be easily scaled to PostgreSQL or MySQL for production environments. Database models include User authentication, Health Status records, and Booking management for appointment scheduling.

**User Authentication and Session Management**: The system leverages Django's built-in authentication framework to provide secure user registration, login, and session management. This ensures that health data remains private and accessible only to authorized users, while maintaining persistent user sessions across multiple monitoring sessions.

**Template System and User Interface**: Django's template engine generates dynamic web pages that display real-time health monitoring results, historical health trends, and appointment scheduling interfaces. The responsive design ensures optimal user experience across desktop and mobile devices.

### F. Online Appointment System Implementation

The online appointment system is seamlessly integrated into the Django web application, providing users with direct access to medical consultation services based on their health monitoring results.

**Hospital Database Integration**: The system maintains a comprehensive database of partner hospitals with detailed information including available departments, specialist doctors, operating hours, and real-time availability. This information is dynamically updated to ensure accurate appointment scheduling.

**Intelligent Recommendation Engine**: Based on AI health detection results, the system automatically suggests appropriate medical departments and specialists. For example, severe dark circle detection may recommend consultation with a sleep specialist or general practitioner, while skin condition alerts may suggest dermatological consultation.

**Real-time Booking Management**: The appointment system provides real-time booking capabilities with instant confirmation, queue status updates, and automated reminder notifications. Users can view available time slots, select preferred hospitals, and receive confirmation details through the Django-powered web interface.

Together, these technologies create a robust, AI-enhanced health monitoring system that maximizes detection accuracy, minimizes false positives, and provides users with intelligent and accessible health assessment capabilities for dark circles, lip conditions, skin health, and overall wellness indicators, while seamlessly connecting them to professional medical care through the integrated appointment system.
