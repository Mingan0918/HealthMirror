## 1. Project Introduction

Good day everyone, I'm honored to present our innovative project - Health Mirror.

Health Mirror is an AI-powered health monitoring system that combines computer vision technology with intelligent medical services. It aims to detect users' health conditions through simple facial scanning and provide convenient medical appointment services.

Our system can detect facial health indicators in real-time, identify dark circles, lip conditions, and skin problems, provide personalized health recommendations, and connect to online hospital appointment systems. This project represents a significant step forward in making health monitoring more accessible and intelligent for everyone.

## 2. Current Social Health Issues

In today's fast-paced modern life, people often neglect their health, and there are several underlying reasons for this critical issue:

**Fast-Paced Lifestyle**: High work pressure and overtime have become the norm. People don't have time for regular health check-ups, and busy lives cause people to ignore their body's warning signals. The modern work culture prioritizes productivity over personal well-being.

**Insufficient Health Awareness**: Young people generally believe they are healthy and don't need special attention. There's a lack of awareness about early health problems, and people only realize the severity when symptoms become obvious. This reactive approach to health often leads to more serious complications.

**Difficulty Accessing Medical Resources**: Long hospital queues, difficult appointments, high medical costs, and geographical limitations make medical resources scarce, especially in remote areas. The healthcare system is often overwhelmed and inaccessible to many who need it most.

**Lack of Convenient Monitoring Tools**: Traditional health check-ups require professional equipment and medical staff. There's a lack of simple and easy-to-use health monitoring methods in daily life that can provide early warning signs.

These problems lead to many health issues being ignored in their early stages, and by the time they're discovered, the optimal treatment window has often been missed.

## 3. Project Motivation

It is based on these pressing social problems that I decided to develop the Health Mirror project.

My goal is to create a system that allows everyone to easily conduct daily health monitoring, making health management as simple as looking in a mirror. I believe that technology should serve humanity by making essential services more accessible and user-friendly.

I hope to use the power of technology to lower the threshold for health monitoring, make preventive healthcare possible, and help people discover and address health problems early. Prevention is always better than cure, and early detection can save both lives and healthcare costs.

At the same time, I also hope to integrate medical resources so that users can conveniently access professional medical services, truly achieving a complete health management loop from detection to treatment. This holistic approach ensures continuity of care and better health outcomes.

## 4. Technical Architecture and Algorithms

Health Mirror employs multiple advanced artificial intelligence algorithms to achieve precise health detection:

### YOLO (You Only Look Once)
We use three specially trained YOLO models: DarkCircles.pt for dark circle detection, Lip_types.pt for lip condition analysis, and skin.pt for skin problem identification. The YOLO algorithm can detect and classify facial features in real-time, providing fast and accurate health condition assessments. This state-of-the-art object detection algorithm ensures high precision and speed in our health monitoring process.

### OpenCV (Computer Vision Library)
OpenCV handles image preprocessing, facial region extraction, and image enhancement. It ensures optimal image quality input to AI models, improving detection accuracy. The library provides robust image processing capabilities that are essential for consistent and reliable health monitoring results.

### InsightFace (Facial Recognition)
InsightFace is used for facial recognition and user authentication, accurately identifying different users and establishing personalized health profiles for each user. This ensures that health data is properly attributed and allows for long-term health tracking and trend analysis.

### DeepSort (Object Tracking)
The DeepSort algorithm is used for multi-object tracking, stably tracking specific users in multi-person environments, ensuring accurate attribution of health data. This is particularly useful in family settings or shared spaces where multiple people might use the system.

## 5. Online Appointment System

Our system integrates complete online medical appointment functionality:

### Hospital Selection System
Users can choose from multiple partner hospitals, including General Hospital KL, Pantai Hospital KL, Prince Court Medical Centre, and Sunway Medical Centre. The system provides hospital addresses, contact information, and geographical location data. This gives users the flexibility to choose healthcare providers based on their preferences, location, and specific medical needs.

### Real-time Queue Monitoring
The system can display real-time queue status and available appointment slots for each hospital, helping users choose the most suitable consultation time and reduce waiting time. This transparency in healthcare scheduling improves patient experience and reduces frustration associated with long waiting times.

### Intelligent Appointment Management
Users can receive consultation recommendations based on detection results. The system recommends appropriate departments and doctors based on the severity of health problems, achieving seamless connection from detection to consultation. This intelligent routing ensures that patients see the right specialists for their specific conditions.

## 6. UN Sustainable Development Goals

The Health Mirror project actively responds to the UN Sustainable Development Goals:

### SDG 3: Good Health and Well-Being
By providing convenient health monitoring tools, we help people detect health problems early, promote preventive healthcare, and improve overall health levels. Our system democratizes access to health monitoring, making it available to people regardless of their economic status or geographical location.

### SDG 4: Quality Education
The system provides health education content, helping users understand the causes and prevention methods of various health problems, improving health literacy. Education is a powerful tool for prevention, and our system empowers users with knowledge about their health.

### SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure
We use cutting-edge technologies such as artificial intelligence and computer vision to promote digital transformation and innovative development in the healthcare field. Our project represents the kind of technological innovation needed to address modern healthcare challenges.

### SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities
By integrating medical resources and providing online services, we help build smarter and more sustainable healthy city ecosystems. Our system contributes to the development of smart cities where technology improves quality of life for all residents.

## 7. Conclusion

Health Mirror is not just a technical project, but an exploration and practice of future health management models.

We believe that through the power of artificial intelligence technology, health monitoring can become more convenient, accurate, and accessible, allowing everyone to enjoy quality health services. Technology should be a great equalizer, breaking down barriers to healthcare access.

The future of healthcare lies in prevention, early detection, and personalized care. Our Health Mirror project embodies these principles by making health monitoring as routine as looking in a mirror, while providing intelligent insights and seamless access to professional medical care.

In the future, we will continue to optimize algorithm accuracy, expand detection functions, integrate more medical resources, and contribute to building a better society with universal health. We envision a world where everyone has access to quality healthcare, and technology serves as the bridge to make this vision a reality.

Thank you for your attention, and I look forward to your questions and feedback!
